        <p class="summary_description">I designed <span class="color_highlight">conversational experiences</span> and led the <span class="color_highlight">user acquisition effort</span> for AVA, a machine-learning chatbot that resolve issues through natural conversation.</p>

    <h2 class="project_template">About the Product</h2>
    <p class="project_template">AVA is machine-learning chatbot that began development in 2017. The web app was a candidate to become the primary way Asurion handled its customer relationship management; but first, it needed to prove it could attract customers (<b>user acquisition</b>) and perform on par with other options (<b>optimization</b>).</p>
    <p class="project_template">I joined the team in 2018 as a principal product designer and led the design for the <b>user acquisition</b>, <a class="project_template">design system</a>, and <b>optimization efforts</b>.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <h3 class="project_template">Major Outcomes</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="project_template">Product Problems</h2>

    <p class="project_template">Customer service and CRM are at the center of Asurion’s business. As a leading provider of device insurance, it has relatively low operational cost aside from the resources it dedicates to its customer service efforts.</p>

    <p class="project_template">The AVA product is a machine-learning, natural language processing chatbot meant to reduce Asurion’s operational cost, while also providing a better customer experience. The product performed well as an MVP, proving that it was capable of handling basic problems, such as filing claims, answering questions, and checking customer’s statuses  in a conversational way.</p>

    <p class="project_template">However, AVA faced a <b>variety of problems</b> that prevented its growth. From a business perspective, AVA <b>wasn’t attracting enough users</b> to show that it could grow. Not only that, AVA’s conversational flows were <b>non-optimal</b>, causing large user dropoff in important features. Its visual and interaction design were both <b>overly simplistic and inconsistent</b>, which appeared untrustworthy or “unfinished” to its users.</p>

    <div class="excerpt">
      <div class="excerpt_subtitle">PRODUCT PROBLEMS</div>
      <div class="excerpt_text">AVA had slow growth, non-optimal flows, and inconsistent design, negatively impacting both user experience and business results.</div>

    <h2 class="project_template">Increasing User Acquisition</h2>
    <div class="ava_image"><img src="img/ava/ava_image-2.jpg" alt="our strategic approach to increase users"></div>
    <p class="caption"><b>Different Experiments:</b> I planned out with the team how we should approach our dependencies and experiments.</p>

    <p class="project_template">After reviewing AVA's acquisition and bounce rates, I interviewed and tested 15+ real users and representative users to better understand why AVA had little success in attracting/keeping users.</p>

    <p class="project_template"><b>Low visual hierarchy:</b> Users rarely noticed the AVA option because of its visual treatment</p>

    <p class="project_template"><b>Unclear content:</b> If users notice the option, the content did not give them enough information to understand what it offered</p>

    <p class="project_template"><b>Low trust:</b> Users who entered AVA found it unpolished and therefore untrustworthy</p>

    <p class="project_template">Based on my findings, I <b>designed three experiments</b>: a minimal content/visual change; a more aggressive full-page modal with more explanatory content; and lastly, a full-page modal with stronger CTAs, listing the various tasks that AVA could perform for the user. Each design was user tested by 10+ users each.</p>

    <div class="ava_image"><img src="img/ava/ava_image-3.jpg" alt="three phrases of experiments"></div>
    <p class="caption"><b>From left to right:</b> Phase 1, the most minimal design; Phase 2, a more aggressive experiment; Phase 3, an experiment with different CTAs</p>

    <p class="project_template">We started with <b>many unknowns about the complexity</b> of developing and tracking each experiment. The landing page on which users accessed AVA was owned by another team, who had not invested time in changing or tracking it beyond bug fixes.</p>

    <p class="project_template">I decided to begin with the <b>most minimal design</b>, which we called Phase 1. Although  Phase 1 was low reward (we didn’t expect a substantial increase in users from Phase 1), <b>it was also low risk</b>. I could pair with our landing page team to understand the development effort, and see how much control I could have over the process. If there were unknowns, the change would not be substantial enough to cause a problem in production.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <h3 class="project_template">Outcomes</h3>
    <p class="project_template-list">I deployed <b>Phase 1</b> to 25% of users, which acquired an average of <b>~8%</b> users (compare to 3% original)</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">I developed <b>Phase 2 and Phase 3</b>, cutting down our A/B test deployment to <b>1.5 weeks</b> (compare to 1.5 months original)</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">I deployed <b>Phase 2</b> to 25% of users, which acquired an average of <b>20%</b> users (compare to 3% original)</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <p class="project_template">I am also working on <b>optimizing the beginning of AVA's flow</b> before we deploy Phase 3, in anticipation of higher bounce rates and drop-offs as we continue acquiring users.</p>

    <h2 class="project_template">Optimizing Conversational Flows and Process</h2>
    <div class="ava_image"><img src="img/ava/ava_image-4.jpg" alt="optimizing conversational flows"></div>
    <p class="caption"><b>Better conversation and design hand-off:</b> I began to refactor our design documentation and hand-off process while optimizing the actual conversational flow.</p>

    <p class="project_template">AVA suffered from two problems regarding its conversational flows.</p>

    <p class="project_template">First, the actual flows were <b>non-optimized</b>. They had not been revisited since MVP release, and sometimes trapped a user into a path that they could not escape. Other times, the user had multiple questions, but would have to refresh the web app in order to ask them one at a time.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Second, the design files were <b>becoming unmaintainable</b>, contributing to poor conversational design, longer development time, and poor documentation. Design files rarely matched production, while some flow designs were missing entirely. Files had extremely poor version control.</p>

    <p class="project_template">I am leading the effort to optimize not only our conversational flows, but our design documentation.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <h3 class="project_template">Outcomes</h3>
    <p class="project_template-list">My goal was maintain FPY to deal with increased users, but I <b>increased FPY to 35%</b> from 30% by optimizing the beginning of the flow</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">I began <b>optimizing the scheduling flow</b> by A/B testing a UI-based or conversational-based approach, finding that users preferred guidance</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">I designed a <b>lean "start over" design</b>, allowing users to ask more questions after the end of a flow path</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">I increased the percentage of design files that <b>matched production</b> and were properly versioned to <b>30%</b> (from 0)</p>

    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="project_template">Next Steps</h2>
    <p class="project_template">My next steps for AVA are to improve its user experience and user metrics by:</p>

    <br>

    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(1)</b> Designing, documenting, and implementing a <a class="project_template" href="design-system.html">design system for AVA</a></p>
    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(2)</b> Optimizing conversational flows that end abruptly or have high user drop-off</p>
    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(3)</b> Further increasing user acquisition for AVA while maintaining FPY and bounce rate</p>
    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(4)</b> Revising the way design versions files and hands off designs to development</p>
