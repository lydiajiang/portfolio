    <h2 class="project_template">Executive Summary</h2>
    <p class="project_template">I was the <b>lead product designer</b> on Virtual Assist, a product which connects repair facilities and consumers with their insurance companies through video chat. Like many insurance companies, Allstate has a complicated <b>claims process</b>; when customers file an auto or property claim, insurance companies will inspect the car or house and <b>estimate</b> the cost of repair. <b>Estimating</b> is a large part of many of these companies’ claims processes, and it largely occurs by sending a company employee to physically visit the damaged asset.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Estimating is a <b>labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive</b> process for these insurance companies, and a painful experience for their customers who have to wait or experience multiple visits by estimators. Virtual Assist was Allstate’s experimental solution to these problems, by providing a virtual way to estimate assets.</p>

    <p class="project_template">I was the product designer chosen to work on this product, due to being <b>full-stack</b> - having research, testing, UX/UI design, and front-end skills. I became a manager and senior product designer based on the success of this product.</p>

    <h3 class="project_template">Major Outcomes</h3>

    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/majoroutcomes.jpg" alt="major outcomes for Virtual Assist"></div>

    <p class="project_template">Virtual Assist took <b>6 months</b> of design and development to push an MVP to production. The MVP consisted of a native iOS app (for repair facilities) and a desktop web app (for Allstate employees to answer calls). When it was first released, only a few repair facilities in the state of Illinois were calling in to two Allstate employees. After a year in production and constant iteration, Virtual Assist had more than <b>11,000 repair facilities</b>   calling in to hundreds of Allstate employees.</p>

    <p class="project_template">The product was later expanded to include a native <b>Android app</b> and mobile React/Java web app. Allstate’s old estimating process took, on average, a full week to complete. Using Virtual Assist, the estimating process takes an <b>average of 45 minutes</b> to complete. Based on its successful results, Allstate restructured its location and hiring process around Virtual Assist, opening 6 operating <centers></centers> nationwide to answer and monitor calls.</p>

    <h4 class="project_template">Other Outcomes</h4>

    <p class="project_template-list">- <b>6 operating centers</b> were opened nationwide to handle VA calls, changing a major part of Allstate’s strategy</p>
  </div>

  <div class="row">

    <h2 class="project_template top_border">Problem Space</h2>

    <p class="project_template">The insurance industry’s current claims process is marked by long cycle time, high operational cost, and poor customer experience.</p>

    <p class="project_template">One of its largest problems lies within the <b>estimating sub-process</b>: the estimated cost of repair to a customer’s car or property needs to be approved by an insurance company. This approval often takes a week, in which a paid adjuster is sent to visit the damaged car or property in-person. While a car is being fixed at a repair facility, auto adjusters may have to visit a damaged car multiple times in-person to approve any <b>supplemental estimates</b> (additional estimates submitted by the repair facility after the first, or <b>initial estimate</b>).</p>

    <div class="excerpt">
      <div class="excerpt_subtitle">PRODUCT PROBLEMS</div>
      <div class="excerpt_text">The current claims process is inefficient, resulting in bad customer experiences, high operational cost for Allstate, and tense relationships with repair facilities (mediators between consumers and insurance).</div>
    </div>

    <p class="project_template">Over the course of several years, Allstate had tried to explore experimental solutions to this problem - many worked in some aspect (better experience) but failed in another (lowering operational cost). I was part of the product team to explore a more technical solution to the problem.</p>

    <h3 class="project_template">Discovery and Research</h3>

    <p class="project_template">Allstate had an idea that they wanted to focus on solving auto estimating first, with the solution being tech-based.</p>

    <p class="project_template">An Agile XP product team was created, with <b>one product manager</b>, <b>eight developers</b>, and <b>one product designer (myself)</b>. We were tasked to reduce the inefficiencies in the estimating process by the Allstate business.</p>

    <p class="project_template">However, the team didn’t feel confident in designing any solution until we understood the <b>priority of the problems</b> we were being asked to solve. We also wanted to validate low fidelity solutions with real users before we invested in development.</p>

    <p class="project_template">From a business perspective, auto and property were the two major areas where the estimating process took place, so we interviewed both Allstate auto and property adjusters.</p>

    <p class="project_template">We chose to focus heavily on auto for MVP. Auto far outweighed property in terms of its volume of estimates and operational cost. To identify and validate problems in the auto space, myself and the team conducted <b>exploratory research</b> with auto repair facilities (focusing on owners and mechanics), Allstate adjusters, and subject matter experts. I combined user interviews and contextual inquiries in order to identify user problems.</p>


    <h3 class="project_template">A Complex System</h3>

    <p class="project_template">Repair facilities and insurance companies share a complex relationship which is rarely surfaced to the customers who bring their cars in. There are several different types of auto estimates (initial, supplemental, total loss, full) and different types of shops (MSO, mom-and-pop, DRP). Each type of repair facility and estimate interacts and affects this relationship.</p>

    <p class="project_template">I visited <b>25+ repair facilities</b> and interviewed <b>10+ auto adjusters</b> over the course of the product’s one year development to document this process. I surfaced frustrations from each side while gaining context in this highly specialized space. This information helped identify different user groups’ pains, prioritize the team’s backlog, and validate/invalidate business requirements and assumptions.</p>

    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/image_01.jpg" alt="user research"></div>

    <p class="project_template">The team and myself took turns visiting facilities to record the sounds, locations, network connections, and lighting of multiple repair facilities. We wanted to understand if there were risks to relying on something like photo, video, or wi-fi in our eventual solution. An MSO (multi-shop organization) facility might be outfitted with tablets and well-lit open floors, while local shops might have cramped, poorly-lit, and loud spaces.</p>

    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/va_image-2.jpg" alt="user research conducted at repair facilities"></div>


    <h3 class="project_template">Design Ideation</h3>

    <p class="project_template"><b>Two major problems</b> from both sides (Allstate and repair facilities) stood out to the team. The same problem appeared on both sides: both Allstate and repair facilities felt that the process was painfully long and costly. Both parties felt that this negatively impacted their business and relationships with their customers.</p>

    <div class="excerpt">
      <div class="excerpt_subtitle">TWO MATCHING PROBLEMS</div>
      <div class="excerpt_text">From both a repair facility and insurance company perspective, the biggest problem with the estimating process is the same: its high inefficiency (unnecessarily time-consuming, costly, and unstructured).</div>
    </div>

    <p class="project_template">While the problem seemed simple (high inefficiency), the solution was <b>far from simple</b>. It was limited by many key facts discovered during the research phase.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Adjusters and repair facility employees are <b>highly skilled</b> workers, who gain the majority of their skills through on-the-field work. Many adjusters stay in their career for up to twenty years. While mechanics are as skilled as adjusters, they aren’t perfectly matched in skillset. Shop owners and mechanics are more focused on actually repairing the vehicle. Adjusters need specific information that <b>only applies to insurance</b>. They need to know specific facts about the car and need to visually inspect many aspects of it that the mechanic does not know how to anticipate.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Unless the damage is extremely minor, adjusters are rarely able to produce an accurate estimate by just looking at photos of the damaged car. Even if the photos of the car’s exterior are taken perfectly, the adjusters are missing <b>half of the information</b> they need to estimate - they need to see the damage underneath the exterior.</p>

    <p class="project_template">There are also different types of auto adjusters. A specialized adjuster might be one who knows how to estimate motorcycles, is familiar with exotic cars, or understands how to repair for uncommon materials (such as aluminum exteriors).</p>

    <p class="project_template">The team <b>ideated, tested, and iterated</b> on a variety of different ideas that could solve these problems while accounting for these limitations.</p>

    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/image_02.jpg" alt="ideation results"></div>


    <p class="project_template">We decided that MVP would focus on the relationship between repair facilities, mitigation vendors (the equivalent of repair facilities in property), and Allstate. The first feature set would be based on the fact that repair facilities would place a video call, which would be answered by an on-demand adjuster.</p>


    <h3 class="project_template">UX/UI Design and User Testing</h3>

    <p class="project_template">The app’s design and feature set <b>iterated together several times</b>, based on changing requirements and user testing.</p>

    <p class="project_template">The first iteration was extremely simple, using Allstate branding and a linear flow to let users place a video call. It was a team decision from all three disciplines to keep the feature set and flow extremely minimal until we understood how users would respond to it.</p>

    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/image_03.jpg" alt="the first iteration"></div>

    <p class="project_template">I later designed the <b>Android mobile app</b> and mobile web app (for consumers) with the same feature set, which was released while the team refactored the desktop and iOS application.</p>

    <p class="project_template">The later iterations included a more <b>advanced onboarding process</b>, which walked repair facilities and mitigation vendors through inputting their information. This information would be saved when the user returned to the app, helping connect their call to the correct adjuster. In previous iterations, user information was not saved, which I surfaced as a user pain to prioritize in our backlog.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Allstate colors and logos were removed in order to <b>white-label</b> the product and sell it as a service to others. Other companies, from repair facilities to other insurance companies, had expressed interest in using the app for themselves.</p>

    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/va_image-3.jpg" alt="the latest iteration"></div>

    <p class="project_template">User testing was crucial to my design process. New features were prototyped and tested before being developed. I consistently tested our UAT environments before features were pushed into production, and I observed our app in production in the actual context of use after major releases.</p>

    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/va_image-4.jpg" alt="user research conducted at repair facilities"></div>

    <p class="caption"><b>Testing Prototypes and Observing the App in Prod:</b> Running user tests always generated unexpected results. I observed users opting to use tablets instead of mobile phones, or using the video feature to discuss paper invoices instead of sending an email. Each round of testing resulted in iterations in the product’s design.</p>


    <p class="project_template">One of the most challenging aspects of the product’s design was <b>balancing design debt</b> with immediate user value. As a team, we had chosen to focus on designing for the user and business problems which we could solve in the next few months - not the next year. This mindset, while it drove the product’s success, also lent itself heavily to design debt. User testing was able to inform when and why we should focus on long-term or short-term solutioning; as the product was iteratively designed and then released, I conducted regular user observations and user tests over the course of six months. Whenever I brought back poor usability as a finding of testing/observation for a short-term solution, the team knew a longer-term solution was the better path.</p>


    <h3 class="project_template">Front-End Development and Product Strategy</h3>
    <div class="ava_image-small"><img src="img/virtualassist/va_image-5.jpg" alt="pairing with developers and product managers"></div>
    <p class="caption"><b>From Left to Right:</b> (1) I pair with the devs to check the quality of the design’s implementation; (2) User research (displayed on back wall) is discussed during product milestones (re-inceptions, re-scopings), and (3) I facilitated “design studios”, where all team members, regardless of design background, generate design ideas to solve a product problem.</p>

    <p class="project_template"><b>Front-End Development:</b> I regularly paired with the XP full-stack developers to understand technical limitations and unblock front-end stories, while coaching them in SASS and CSS. Understanding the basics of our codebase helped me prioritize the backlog when I paired with the PM, as well as identify design bugs in the production software. By pairing with the devs regularly, I was able to initiate other XP product teams to move towards using CSS compilers, recommending SASS as the industry standard.</p>

    <p class="project_template"><b>Product Strategy:</b> I became the representative for product design in the claims space, regularly demoing the product to stakeholders and potential clients with the PM and dev anchor. I became an architect for Virtual Assist’s future, which transitioned into architecting the claims space’s overall strategy. I was also a facilitator of the difficult discussions of its future (re-inceptions, scopings, iteration decisions, and kickoffs), where I recommended evolving our approach to user research to become more quantitative.</p>


    <h2 class="project_template">Next Steps</h2>

    <p class="project_template">I was rolled off the team to spearhead the <a class="project_template" href="photo-intake.html">Photo Intake effort</a>. When I rolled off, I identified the following next steps for the product and its design:</p>

    <br><br>

    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(1)</b> Solidify consistency in the design system used across the Virtual Assist applications</p>

    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(2)</b> Establish unmoderated user testing and product analytics as an important driver of future designs</p>

    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(3)</b> Increase the marketability of the app through improvements in its visual design and feature set (push notifications)</p>

    <p class="project_template-list"><b>(4)</b> Abstract functionality to consume other virtual inspection methods and help other claims processes which have not been modernized</p>
