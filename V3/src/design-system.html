    <h2 class="project_template">About the Project</h2>
    <p class="project_template">AVA is machine-learning chatbot that files claims and answers questions for more than 53k customers/month. The web app faced a crucial period of growth after its initial release, but faced a myriad of design problems. The MVP design was <b>inconsistent</b> and <b>unpleasant</b> to the new influx of users, causing problems in the app's performance and reputation.</p>
    <p class="project_template">I joined the team in 2018 as a principal product designer and led the design system effort. You can learn more about <a class="project_template" href="ava.html">my work on AVA here.</a></p>

    <br><br><br>

    <h3 class="project_template">Major Outcomes</h3>
    <p class="project_template-list">Released the chatbot's <b>first content guide</b>, defining AVA's voice and personality</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">Documented <b>100% of the UI components and patterns</b> in AVA's MVP design</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">Released the <b>first iteration of a design system</b> for the AVA product teams</p>
    <p class="project_template-list">Standardized and <b>optimized AVA's design components</b> to provide a better user experience</p>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="project_template">Content Guide</h2>
    <div class="ava_image"><img src="img/designsystem/ds_image-1.jpg" alt="image showing user research being conducted"></div>
    <p class="caption"><b>Defining our conversation principles:</b> I collaborated on the content guide with a content strategist for an initial release to the team.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Users interact with AVA in a conversational format, making <b>voice</b> and <b>personality</b> a crucial part of AVA's design.</p>

    <p class="project_template">However, there was no consistent source of truth or reference regarding how AVA spoke to consumers. AVA's MVP voice was inconsistent and overly formal, using dated and stiff phrases ("pardon me" or "how may I serve you").</p>

    <p class="project_template">I collaborated with a senior content strategist to visualize, define, and organize a <b>more modern Content Guide</b> that would become part of a <b>larger design system</b>. The guide was released to the entire team, and is used by product managers, designers, and developers to rework old conversational flows and define new ones.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="project_template">Design System Foundations</h2>
    <div class="ava_image"><img src="img/designsystem/ds_image-2.jpg" alt="our strategic approach to increase users"></div>
    <p class="caption"><b>Explaining design systems to the team:</b> I visualized how a design system works for the designers, but also helps the PMs and developers scale the product.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Design systems were a <b>new concept to the AVA team</b>, meaning it required education and collaboration to move the effort forward.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Having worked on two design systems before, I led the effort to <b>architect the design system</b> and determine how it would impact AVA's design process and codebase.</p>

    <p class="project_template">Our first step was to <b>document what existed</b> in AVA's UI.</p>

    <p class="project_template">AVA's design files, design versioning, and front-end code were inconsistent; the design files were often missing crucial assets. This lack of documentation made it difficult for the team to attempt to make AVA's design language consistent.</p>

    <div class="ava_image"><img src="img/designsystem/ds_image-3.jpg" alt="our strategic approach to increase users"></div>
    <p class="caption"><b>Components Defined:</b> I created a template for the team to define components and recreate the missing design assets.</p>

    <p class="project_template">The design team <b>documented 100% of the UI components</b>, foundational components (such as grid and icons), and patterns for AVA. The UI for each component was re-created in a master Sketch file, with rules for layout and styling, recommendations on component usage, and defining different states of each component.</p>

    <p class="project_template">This initial version of the design system <b>facilitated team discussions</b> about how differently they had viewed or used the same components.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="project_template">Redesigning for Consistency</h2>
    <div class="ava_image"><img src="img/designsystem/ds_image-4.jpg" alt="our strategic approach to increase users"></div>

    <p class="project_template">After documentation, my next step is to <b>optimize the most problematic components</b> to the user and monitor their impact.</p>

    <p class="project_template">The goal of the design team is to iteratively make the app <b>meet AA accessibility standards</b>, improve our CX metrics, and meet industry standards around design. From an <b>engineering perspective</b>, our goal is to begin abstracting parts of the UI into a maintainable pattern library.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="project_template">Next Steps</h2>
    <p class="project_template">My immediate next goal is to set up a design system and pattern library which can contain the content guide, component documentation, design files, and code.</p>
